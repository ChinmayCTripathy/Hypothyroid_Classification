# Hypothyroid_Classification
Developed a machine learning model for hypothyroid disease classification using clinical data. Implemented preprocessing, imputation, encoding, and scaling on 30 features, trained models like Random Forest, SVM, and AdaBoost, achieving F1 > 0.99 and ROC-AUC ≈ 0.997 with SHAP-based interpretability.
